# Transcriptomics Projects

This repository contains two projects completed as part of the Master's degree Transcriptomics course.

## Projects Overview

1. **Bulk RNA-seq Analysis**  
   This project involves the analysis of bulk RNA-sequencing data. It covers data preprocessing, quality control, normalization, differential expression analysis, and functional annotation. The goal was to gain insights into the gene expression patterns across different conditions or cell types.

2. **Single-cell RNA-seq Analysis**  
   This project focuses on single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. It includes steps such as quality control, normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and cell-type identification. The project aims to explore cellular heterogeneity and identify distinct cell populations within the sample.
